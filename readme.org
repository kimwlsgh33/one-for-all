#+title: One for all

* One For All
** What want to make
*** Virtual Processing or Virtual Threading ( Inspired by Erlang )
+ For thousand of websockets => full interactive, effective and reasonable apps
+ Using concurrency, parallel without verbose boilerplate as async, and without any performance cost.

*** Using javascript without javascript
+ We need javascript, whereas don't like syntax.

*** Implement all of services, by one language
+ Too many language, too many learning.
+ Create the wheel, but first we need to use the past one. Code compatible and anternating => Refactor purpose language

*** Fault-tolerant
+ We are lazy, so we need ability to choose when we code.

*** Multi-model Database (General purpose)
+ In modern programing world, we need multiple database even if our service's main purpose is one.
+ We need general purpose database.

*** Express the math formula in programming language ( Inspired by Julia )
+ We need to express math formula more accurately in programming language
  ( all of the unicode )

** What need to make
*** TODO [#B] Understand about Virtual Machine for Virtual Processing and Fault-tolerant
**** [ ] Search learning documents and list up
***** How long?
***** What through?
**** [ ] Find who knows this well

*** TODO [#B] Understanding programming language's main structure and control flow (by Zig?) => for OFA
**** [ ] Cloning interpreter & compiler in GO => [[file:./lang/index.org][WIIG & WCIG]]
***** How long?
Until the end
***** What through?
**** [ ] Learning about the [[file:./lang/index.org][internals of Zig compiler]]

**** [ ] Cloning exist database briefly
***** How long?
***** What through?
****** [[file:./db/index.org][toydb]] in Rust
****** [[file:./db/index.org][SQLite clone]] in C
**** [ ] Analyse exist database
[[https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb][SurrealDB]] - multi-model database written in Rust
**** [ ] Contribute with opensource database project
