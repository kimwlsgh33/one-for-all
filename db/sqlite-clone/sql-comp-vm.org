#+title: World's Simplest SQL Compiler and Virtual Machine

* The front-end
** SQL compiler
parses a string and outputs an internal representation called bytecode.

** Virtual Machine
recived bytecode from SQL compiler and executes it.

* Advantages of separating front-end as this structure
- Reduces the complexity (VM doesn't worried about syntax errors)
- Allows compiling comon queries once and =caching= the bytecode for improve performance

* Flow
None-SQL statements like ~.exit~ are caleld "meta-commands"
