* The way I like in this book.
/Skip that part not because it's too complex, but because it would take away from the essential simpleness, making it harder to understand/

Suited to our =needs=

To see the benefits they provide.
To see the drawbacks they have.
To see the problems they solve.

* The things what I'm learned in this book (what I'm focused on)
** Behave depending on the right purpose
Don't see other's code before fully understand the problems
** Push your code to remote only when you...
I need a convention about flow about managing git
** The ordered list of program is useful when I understand the code

* What I'm curious about
** Why "rescue", "catch" are not easy to use?

* Referece
